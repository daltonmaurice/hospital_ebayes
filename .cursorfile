The following is a package written in Stata using Mata matrix language
and provides a stata ado file for estimating empirical bayes estimates
of hospital quality. This file is for for LLM.


# Statistical theory

This code is based on empirical bayes estimates and work done in the teacher value-added literature. Code used to create https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31789/w31789.pdf.

# Code

The code is found in `src` and `hospital_ebayes.ado` is the main script being developed. 
This is a form of the vam.ado file found in the stata ssc and developed 
http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/v/vam.ado. 


# Test suite 

Simulated data is created by `test/sim_data.do` and is save in `test.dta`.

`test/test_vamhosp.do` test that the options in the function work.

`test/test_vamcomparison.do` are a test against the original vam code found in `test/vam_original.do` which is form the http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/v/vam.ado. 

# Docs

Docs are written in markdown using the python mkdoc-material packaage and can be found in `docs`
